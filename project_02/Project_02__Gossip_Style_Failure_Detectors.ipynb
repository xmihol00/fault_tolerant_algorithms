        "## A Gossip Style Failure Detection Service\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework, you are asked to modify and extend the above example to implement a gossip style failure detection protocol based on the following publication: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/GossipFD.pdf. The protocol was also covered in the lecture. The essential points are summarized below (also see Section 2 in the paper and revisit the slides of Lecture 4 -- Coordination). \n",
        "\n",
        "Each node maintains a list with for each known node its address and an integer which is going to be used for failure detection. We call the integer the _heartbeat counter_. Every $T_{gossip}$ seconds, each node increments its own heartbeat counter, and selects one other node at random to send its list to. Upon receipt of such a gossip message, a node merges the list in the message with its own list, and adopts the maximum heartbeat counter for each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each node also maintains, for each other node in the list, the last time that its corresponding heartbeat counter has increased. If the heartbeat counter has not increased for more than $T_{fail}$ seconds, then the node is considered failed. $T_{fail}$ is selected so that the probability that anybody makes an erroneous failure detection is less than some small threshold $P_{mistake}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a node is considered faulty, it cannot immediately be forgotten about. The problem is that not all nodes will detect failures at the same time, and thus a node A may receive a gossip about another node B that A has previously detected as faulty. If A had forgotten about B, it would reinstall B in its membership list, since A would think that it was seeing B’s heartbeat for the first time. A would continue to gossip this information on to other nodes, and, in effect, the faulty node B never quite disappears from the membership.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the failure detector does not remove a node from its membership list until after $T_{cleanup}$ seconds ($T_{cleanup} \\geq T_{fail}$). $T_{cleanup}$ is chosen so that the probability that a gossip is received about this node, after it has been detected as faulty, is less than some small threshold $P_{cleanup}$. We can make $P_{cleanup}$ equal to $P_{fail}$ by setting $T_{cleanup}$ to $2 \\times T_{fail}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see why, let B be some failed node, and consider another node A that heard B’s last heartbeat at time $t$. With probability $P_{fail}$, every other node will have heard B’s last heartbeat by $t+T_{fail}$, and so every process will fail B by time $t+2\\times T_{fail}$. Thus, if we set $T_{cleanup}$ to $2\\times T_{fail}$, then with probability $P_{fail}$, no failed node will ever reappear on A’s list of nodes once that node has been removed."
